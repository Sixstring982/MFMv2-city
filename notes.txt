If a building can't see a street or an intersection from a sidewalk, he needs to be consumed by a neighboring building.

If buildings are changing, the sidewalks need to be able to rebuild their maps.
Sidewalks rebuild as long as a neighbor's timer is above 80% full and rebuilding.
Sidewalks remap if they see a block across the street do the same, but only with a small random chance.

Check that roads create sidewalks near intersections.
Fix: Have intersections look at all roads in moore and create missing sidewalks near them.
